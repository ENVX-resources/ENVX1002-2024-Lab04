Your demonstrators will use the start of this practical to discuss how you may be feeling for this first assessment and share ways you might want to approach and prepare for the assessment.\nThis is the last reflective activity for now, thank you all for contributing so far and we hope you have found some benefit in the activities. Now for some probability!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes\n\n\n\nAt the end of this computer practical, students should be able to:\n\ncalculate tail, interval and inverse probabilities associated with the Normal distribution\ncalculate probabilities associated sampling distribution of the sample mean by using simulation in R and using R commands."
